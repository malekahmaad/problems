# DSA problems

This repository contains Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems that I took from the AI and solved it.

Each problem includes:

- A clear description

- Input/output examples

- My Python solution

- Basic test cases
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DAY 1:

1- problem 1: Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

example: 

Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]  

Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

2- problem 2: Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

example: 

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2] 

Output: 4

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DAY 2:

1- problem 3: Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements.

example: 

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2   

Output: [1,2]

# DAY 3:

1- problem 4: You are given an integer array coins representing coin denominations, and an integer amount representing a total amount of money. Return the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount. If it is not possible, return -1.

example: 

Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11  

Output: 3 , Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

2- problem 5: Given a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is formed by connecting adjacent '1's horizontally or vertically (not diagonally). You may assume the grid is surrounded by water ('0's).

example: 

Input: grid = [ ["1","1","0","0","0"],
                ["1","1","0","0","0"],
                ["0","0","1","0","0"],
                ["0","0","0","1","1"]
              ]                                    
              
Output: 3
