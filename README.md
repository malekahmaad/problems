# problems

this repository contains data structures and algorithms problems that I took from the AI and solved it

# DAY 1:

1- problem 1: Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

example: 

Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]  Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

2- problem 2: Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

example: 

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2] Output: 4
